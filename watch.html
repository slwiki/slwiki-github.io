<h2>Step 1:Check the wifi connection between Apple Watch and iPhone.</h2><p>There are two ways to check the connection between your Apple Watch and iPhone:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see&nbsp;<img alt="red Disconnected icon" src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/applewatch/watch-disconnected-icon.png" width="16">&nbsp;on the watch face, you don't have a connection.<p  style="color:red">*Will more likely is using Bluetooth only which will not work when pairing with apple watch*</p></li>
<li>Swipe up on the watch face to open Control Center, which shows if your devices are connected.&nbsp;You can also&nbsp;tap&nbsp;<img alt=" iPhone icon" src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/applewatch/apple-watch-ping-phone-icon.png" width="40">. If connected, your iPhone should make a &quot;ping&quot; sound.</li>
</ul>

<p>open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and (making sure you're in the lefthand tab, My Watch) tap the&nbsp;Apple Watch you want to unpair at the top (make sure you pick the right one - you can have more than one watch paired with a single iPhone). On the next screen you'll be given&nbsp;options to unpair the watch, or use Find My Apple Watch to pair the apple watch again.</p>
