<h2 class="sectionHeadline"><a id="jump-1justthemacappstore" class="anchor"></a>1. Just the Mac App Store</h2><p>The safest option to choose here would be the "Mac App Store," since Apple reviews all apps that are accepted in their store and can remove them quickly if necessary. Basically, you'll know that your Mac will be as free as possible from malware if you use this option only.</p></section>
<section>
<h2 class="sectionHeadline"><a id="jump-2macappstoreamptrusteddevelopers" class="anchor"></a>2. Mac App Store &amp; Trusted Developers</h2><p>The next option also trusts apps from "identified developers," which are basically developers with a unique Developer ID from Apple who have their apps signed digitally. This is the option I use, since Apple can verify that there hasn't been any tampering with the apps since they were signed.</p></section>
<section>
<h2 class="sectionHeadline"><a id="jump-3appsfromanywhere" class="anchor"></a>3. Apps from Anywhere</h2><p>The last option, "Anywhere," obviously removes Gatekeeper's blocking capabilities on your Mac, letting you install and open any app off the internet, including Automator apps made by individuals. Sometimes these things have malware baked in, so I would recommend using the "identified developers" option and okay installation of apps missing a Developer ID on a case-by-case basis.</p></section>

<h2 class="sectionHeadline"><a id="jump-trustingappsonacasebycasebasis" class="anchor"></a>Trusting Apps on a Case-by-Case Basis</h2><p>If you have the "Mac App Store and identified developers" option selected, then whenever you download an app without a Developer ID and try to open it, you'll get the following warning.</p><ul><li>"App Name" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer</li></ul> <figure><figure class="whtGallery pad-2" id="61715780docPartGal880017" role="group"><div class="gallery-layout"><div class="gallery-layout-container"><figure class="gal-mgb" data-index="0"><img src="https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/65/00/63549500300775/0/open-third-party-apps-from-unidentified-developers-mac-os-x.w1456.jpg" alt="How to Open Third-Party Apps from Unidentified Developers in Mac OS X" width="532" height="532" style="max-width:532px;height:auto;"/></figure></div></div></figure></figure> <p>To bypass this restriction, select "OK" on the popup to close it, then go into the "Security &amp; Privacy" section in your "System Preferences." Below the Gatekeeper options in the "General" tab, you'll see the app that was blocked from opening. To trust it, select "Open Anyway" and that's it.</p> <figure><figure class="whtGallery pad-2" id="30530416docPartGal880019" role="group"><div class="gallery-layout"><div class="gallery-layout-container"><figure class="gal-mgb" data-index="0"><img src="https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/75/46/63549500655103/0/open-third-party-apps-from-unidentified-developers-mac-os-x.w1456.jpg" alt="How to Open Third-Party Apps from Unidentified Developers in Mac OS X" width="532" height="532" style="max-width:532px;height:auto;"/></figure></div></div></figure></figure> </section>
